# Chaos Engineering Practice

##### Super-formal definition:
"Chaos Engineering is the discipline of *experimenting* on a distributed system in order to build **confidence** in the system's capability to withstand ***turbulent conditions in production***."

##### five advanced practices:
- Build a hypothesis around steady-state behavior
- Vary real-world events
- Run experiments in production
- Automate experiments to run continuously
- Minimize blast radius
